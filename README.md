PouchDB Ionic "hello world" app
======

_**Note:** this is for Ionic 1. For an Ionic 2 versions, see [pouch-ionic2-hello-world](https://github.com/djuniorscjr/pouch-ionic2-hello-world)._

This is a basic Ionic app. It was created using the `ionic` CLI, by running:

    ionic start pouchdb-ionic-hello-world

Then to install PouchDB, I ran:

    bower install --save pouchdb
    
(So you may need to run `bower install` in order to download the `pouchdb.js` file.)

Then I added `pouchdb.js` to `index.html`:

```html
<script src="lib/pouchdb/dist/pouchdb.min.js"></script>
```

To run the app yourself on a variety of platforms, just check out the code and follow the instructions below.
